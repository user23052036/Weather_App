# 🌦 Contributing to Weather_App


## 📌 Requirements

Before contributing, please ensure you have:

✔ Java 11 or higher  
✔ Git installed — https://git-scm.com/downloads  
✔ A Java IDE such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse

<br>

## 🔰 Step 1 — Fork this repository

1. Click the **Fork** button on GitHub (top-right).
2. GitHub will create a copy in your profile — this is where you will work.

<br>

## 🔰 Step 2 — Clone your fork


Open terminal / CMD / PowerShell and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Weather_App.git
cd Weather_App
```
⚠️ Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username.

<br>

## 🔰 Step 3 — Open the project in your IDE

* Open the cloned folder in your IDE.
* The Java source files live inside the `src/` folder.
* Run the app by locating the main class (AppLauncher/Main) inside `src`.

If the app runs successfully, you are ready to contribute.

<br>


## 🔧 Step 4 — Create a new branch

Always create a separate branch before coding:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
```

Examples:

```
feature/add-screenshot
fix/invalid-city-error
docs/add-javadoc
```

<br>

## ✍️ Step 5 — Make your changes

* Modify or add code
* Test your change by running the app
* Add screenshots if your change affects UI

<br>

## 💾 Step 6 — Commit your work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add UI screenshot to README"
```

Be descriptive but short:

Examples:

✔ `fix: handle empty city input`<br>
✔ `docs: add usage instructions`<br>
✔ `feat: add temperature unit toggle`

<br>

## 🚀 Step 7 — Push to your fork

```bash
git push origin feature/<branch-name>
```

<br>

## 📮 Step 8 — Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. You will see a **Compare & Pull Request** button.
3. Fill the PR template with:

✔ What you changed<br>
✔ Why it helps<br>
✔ Screenshot (if UI related)<br>
✔ Issue number (e.g., `Closes #2`)

Once submitted, maintainers will review your changes, give feedback if needed, and merge when approved.

<br>

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, make sure:

* The app builds successfully
* The UI works correctly
* Your feature/error fix does not break other parts
* Large changes are explained clearly

<br>

## 📎 Coding Tips

* Keep functions short and readable
* Use meaningful variable names
* Comment tricky logic
* Follow existing patterns

Beginners — don’t worry; PR review is meant to help you learn.
